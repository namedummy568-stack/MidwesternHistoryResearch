# Chapter 3 Notes: The Great Migration's Impact on Chicago and St. Louis

## Chicago
### Demographic Shifts
*   **1910-1920:** African American population in Chicago grew from 44,103 to 109,485 (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1920). This represents a 148% increase.
*   **1920-1930:** Continued rapid growth to 233,903 (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1930). The 'Black Belt' expanded significantly on the South Side.
*   **New Census Data (1930-1940):** Preliminary analysis of 1940 census data indicates a further increase to approximately 278,000, showing sustained migration even during the Depression era (Source: Preliminary Census Reports, 1940).
### Economic Impact
*   **Labor Force:** Migrants filled critical roles in meatpacking plants (e.g., Union Stock Yards) and steel mills (e.g., U.S. Steel South Works). Wages were significantly higher than in the South, though often lower than for white workers.
*   **Entrepreneurship:** Rise of Black-owned businesses along State Street and Indiana Avenue, serving the growing community (e.g., banks, insurance companies, newspapers like The Chicago Defender).
### Social and Cultural Developments
*   **Bronzeville:** Emergence of a vibrant cultural hub, known for jazz clubs, theaters, and intellectual life.
*   **Housing:** Severe housing shortages and restrictive covenants led to overcrowding and segregation. Rent parties became common.

## St. Louis
### Demographic Shifts
*   **1910-1920:** African American population increased from 43,960 to 69,854 (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1920), a 59% increase.
*   **1920-1930:** Growth continued to 93,580 (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1930).
*   **Refined Figures (1930-1940):** Revised estimates suggest the African American population reached around 110,000 by 1940, slightly higher than initial projections due to continued secondary migration from smaller Southern towns (Source: St. Louis Urban League Reports, 1941).
### Economic Impact
*   **Industrial Labor:** Migrants found work in industries such as meatpacking, foundries, and railroads. Many women worked in domestic service.
*   **East St. Louis Riots (1917):** A stark example of racial tension fueled by labor competition and housing pressures, resulting in significant violence and loss of life.
### Social and Cultural Developments
*   **Ville Neighborhood:** Developed as a prominent Black community with its own institutions, schools, and businesses.
*   **Music Scene:** Contributed to the development of blues and ragtime music.

**Key Findings:** Both cities experienced massive demographic shifts and economic contributions from the Great Migration. Chicago's growth was more explosive, leading to a more pronounced cultural flourishing but also intense segregation. St. Louis, while experiencing significant growth, also saw more overt racial violence early in the migration period.
